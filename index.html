        <p><b>Hello!</b></p>
        <p>
            My name is Austin Giordano, and I am currently a senior studying mechanical engineering at the Pennsylvania State University.
I'm set to graduate in May of 2025, and look forward to what the future will bring! This website serves as my professional portfolio for anything
engineering related (I also have a creative portfolio that can be accessed via the button in the top left corner! I am currently using it to learn how to actually build a website, so it has more experimental features on it). I have never done web development before, so I apologize for any bugs that you may run into while exploring my site! I hope that you
find this portfolio valuable in getting to know more about me and my skills.
