            A new feeling budding in my chest,<br>
            A little prickle I couldnâ€™t ignore.<br>
            You intrigued me.<br>
            I wanted to be with you,<br>
            Around you,<br>
            Close to you.<br>

            Exciting.</p>
            
            <p>Summer arrived before long,<br>
            And we grew closer.<br>
            You caressed my heart with your warm embrace.<br>
            Carefree days,<br>
            Wasted time,<br>
            It was all so precious.<br>
            At the height of it,<br>
            it was bright yellow and red.<br>
            It felt like I was burning alive,<br>
            In the best way possible.<br>
            Overwhelming,<br>
            Terrifying,<br>
            I lost myself in it.<br>
            We were in our own world.<br>
            My cheeks were flushed,<br>

Like cinnamon and cider. <br>
It feels hot to the touch, <br>
But not hot enough to burn. <br>
Its texture is smooth but fragile, <br>
Of glass <br>
Like the wood of a burnt out campfire. <br>
It leaves auburn powder on your hands. <br>
Cyanide can kill, <br>
But I donâ€™t feel like it has the intention to. </p>
